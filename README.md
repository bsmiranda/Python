# My Python Projects

This repository contains my projects, studies and tests in Python, serving as a basis for my studies and applications in the development of some programs.

Below are the projects that you will find in this repository, their functionalities and installation requirements.

## Restaurant app

A back end project developed in Python to register restaurants of different categories.

Modules and functions, lists and dictionaries, exception handling were implemented and tests were carried out to guarantee the program's functionalities that are organized into functions.

### Requirements to run the project

The version of Python used was 3.12.0, taking advantage of the latest features and improvements introduced.

The project was developed in VS Code, but you can feel free to run the program in your preferred IDE.

### How to use the project

Restaurants are registered by name and category.

The program presents the user with four possible options:

    1. Register restaurant
    2. List restaurant
    3. Toggle restaurant status
    4. Exit

To register a restaurant, the program asks the user to enter the name and category of the restaurant. The status always starts with the parameter deactivated and can be activated by the user in the options menu.

When registering a new restaurant, the user returns to the options menu where he can list the existing restaurants by pressing the 2 key.

This option displays registered restaurants with their respective names, categories and activation status on the screen.

Restaurants can be enabled in option 3 where the user is asked to enter the name of the restaurant they would like to toggle the status to enabled or disabled.
